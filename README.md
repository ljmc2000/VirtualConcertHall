# Summary
My project is a realtime networking application. It is the goal of my project to create a virtual space where musicians can play together in realtime. The users will be divided into “rooms” and users in the same room will able to hear oneanother as well as see what notes the other players are pressing. After they have finished their jam session they will have the option of downloading a record of it in the form of a midi file or maybe a WAV. The latency must be negligable. Users must log in in order to open a room. Non signed in users will be able to play but not to recover their performance. Only data that is midi encodable will be transmitable. Singing will be impossible. The client shall run in a browser window connecting to a server via webRTC. My evaluation strategy depends upon how many users I can glean interest from. I could do evaluations by running the application on many networks ranging from reliable to downright abysmal. I could also show it to musicians and ask their opinion. Either user reviews or lab results could both serve as valuable evaluation.
